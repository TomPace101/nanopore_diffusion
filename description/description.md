# Background

We seek the effective diffusion constant for a nanoporous membrane.
The pore geometry is variable, as is the diffusion equation.

# Given

## Geometry
We study both a body-centered rectangular lattice of pores,
as well as a face-centered lattice of pores.
The symmetry of the geometry is used.

The geometry and geometric variables are shown below.
