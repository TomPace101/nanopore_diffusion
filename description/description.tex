\title{Problem Description for Diffusion Through Nanopore}
\author{Tom Pace}
\maketitle

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Background}\label{sec:background}

We study a silica membrane containing nanoscopic circular pores arranged in a two-dimensional lattice.
We desire to understand the rate of transport of different ions through the nanopores,
quantified in terms of an effective diffusion constant.
The pore geometry is variable, as is the diffusion equation governing transport.

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{System Geometry}\label{sec:geometry}

We study both a body-centered rectangular lattice of pores,
as well as a face-centered lattice of pores.
The unit cell geometry has two planes of symmetry.
This symmetry is used to reduce the model to only one quarter of the unit cell.

The body-centered geometry is shown in Figure \ref{fig:body-intro}.
The face-centered geometry is shown in Figure \ref{fig:face-intro}.

The geometric variables are:

$\begin{array}{rcl}
Sx & = & 2 Lx =\text{Unit cell x-dimension} \\
Sy & = & 2 Ly =\text{Unit cell y-dimension} \\
Lx & = & \frac{Sx}{2} =\text{Model x-dimension} \\
Ly & = & \frac{Sy}{2} =\text{Model y-dimension} \\
R & = & \text{Pore radius} \\
tm & = & \text{Membrane thickness} = \text{Pore length} \\
H & = & \text{Distance from membrane surface to model boundary}
\end{array}$

\section{Diffusion Constant}\label{sec:D}

To compute the equivalent diffusion constant, the problem is treated as a one-dimensional diffusion problem.
That is, we consider diffusion in the direction across the membrane.
The total flux across the membrane will be related to the effective diffusion constant by:

$$J = D \frac{\Delta c}{\Delta x}$$

where:

$\begin{array}{rcl}
J & = & \text{integral of flux over the pore, e.g. moles per unit time} \\
D & = & \text{unknown effective diffusion constant} \\
\Delta c & = & \text{change in concentration} \\
\Delta x & = & \text{distance over which concentration changes}
\end{array}$

Re-arranging this equation to solve for the unknown $D$, we have:

$$D = J \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta c}$$

The integrated flux, $J$ is calculated from the model by integrating
the ion flux over a surface parallel to the membrane surface.
The result should be the same for any such surface capturing the full extents of the model.
That is, the integrated flux should be the same when integrating over the pore as
when integrating over the upgradient or downgradient boundary of the model.

Specifically, the integrated flux is calculated as:

$$J = \int dA \left(\hat{n} \cdot \vec{\nabla} c \right)$$

where $\hat{n}$ is the directed normal to the surface,
and $c$ is the concentration field found by solving the model.

The values of $\Delta c$ and $\Delta x$ are calculated by extracting
the concentration result at two points located symmetrically on opposite sides of the membrane.
The difference in concentration between these two points is $\Delta c$,
and the distance between them is $\Delta x$.

Slightly different results for the value fo $D$ could be attained by selecting different
pairs of symmetrically located points.
For consistency, the results here are taken with these two points located
along the centerline of the pore, at both faces of the membrane.
