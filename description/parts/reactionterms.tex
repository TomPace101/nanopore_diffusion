\section{Reaction-Diffusion Systems}\label{sec:reactionterms}

Consider a system in which species concentrations change not only due to diffusion,
but also due to chemical reactions.
The chemical reactions add new terms to the equations for $\frac{\partial c_s}{\partial t}$.

In general terms, for $N_r$ chemical reactions indexed by $r$,
we write each reaction in the form

\begin{equation}
  \sum_{s=1}^{N_s} R_{rs} \mathrm{X}_s \longrightarrow \sum_{s=1}^{N_s} P_{rs} \mathrm{X}_s
\end{equation}

where $R_{rs}$ and $P_{rs}$ are the stoichiometric coefficients
of the reactants and products, respectively,
and $\mathrm{X}_s$ represents species $s$.

Note that reversible reactions must be considered as two separate reactions:
the forward reaction and reverse reaction.

The rate of each reaction is governed by its rate law.
Rate laws are defined here by both a rate constant, $k_r$,
and a rate function, $f_r$, which is a function of the concentration
of all reactant species for the reaction.
To provide a consistent set of arguments to these functions,
we consider the rate functions to potentially depend instead
on all species concentrations,
writing them as $f_r\left(\underline{c}\right) = f_r\left(c_0, c_1, \ldots \right)$.
Typical rate laws include products of the reactant concentrations,
with each concentration raised to a power known as the order of the reaction
for the given species.

Using this notation, the change in the concentration of each species
due to the presence of the chemical reactions alone is written as

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial c_s}{\partial t} = 
  \sum_{r=1}^{N_r} \left( P_{rs} - R_{rs} \right) k_r f_r\left(\underline{c}\right)
\end{equation}

Defining a net stoichiometric coefficient $N_{rs} = P_{rs} - R_{rs}$,
which will be positive for reactions producing a species and negative
for reactions consuming it, this becomes

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial c_s}{\partial t} = 
  \sum_{r=1}^{N_r} N_{rs} k_r f_r\left(\underline{c}\right)
\end{equation}

The weak form of this equation is simply

\begin{equation}
  \int_\Omega \frac{\partial c_s}{\partial t} v_s \,\mathrm{d}^3x = 
  \sum_{r=1}^{N_r} N_{rs} k_r \int_\Omega f_r\left(\underline{c}\right) v_s \,\mathrm{d}^3x
\end{equation}

For systems with both reactions and diffusion,
the reaction terms on the right side can simply be added to the diffusion
equation for each species. That is,

\begin{equation}
  \boxed{
    \int_\Omega \frac{\partial c_s}{\partial t} v_s \,\mathrm{d}^3x = 
    D_s WSS_s +
    \sum_{r=1}^{N_r} N_{rs} k_r \int_\Omega f_r\left(\underline{c}\right) v_s \,\mathrm{d}^3x
  }
\end{equation}

Note that one consequence of this is that the species-specific diffusion constants
must be retained even when seeking a steady-state solution.
